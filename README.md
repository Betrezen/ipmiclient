Hi,
I guess you already know about IPMI. IPMI boards can be installed on server in order to manager server despite server can be switched off. It is Upper manager :) which can do something on server through IPMI chip which is available through network. That is Cool! OK. How to manager server through IPMI? Actually you can use different IPMI tools - like ipmitool or freeipmi or other. BY any way all those tool using IPMI binary protocol.
I would like to show python example which utilize IPMItool and provide several IPMI commands.
